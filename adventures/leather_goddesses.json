  "intro": "It's 1936. You're in a seedy bar in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, nursing a drink\nand contemplating life's disappointments.\n\nSuddenly, nature calls. You head to the restroom. But when you emerge,\neverything has changed. An alien just walked past. Your bartender has\ntentacles. And someone slipped a strange device into your pocket.\n\nBefore you can process this, a holographic message activates:\n\n'Greetings, Earthling! The Leather Goddesses of Phobos plan to enslave\nyour planet using their Kinetic Integrated Sinister Sex-ray! You must\nstop them! Collect the three vital components scattered across space\nand time, build the Anti-Leather-Goddess-of-Phobos Device, and save Earth!\n\nOh, and try not to die. Good luck!'\n\nWell, this beats another boring Tuesday.\n\nNote: This is a TAME version. The original had adjustable naughtiness levels.",
