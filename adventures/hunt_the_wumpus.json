The cave\nhas hazards: bottomless pits that will kill you, and giant bats that\nwill carry you to random rooms.\n\nYou have 5 crooked arrows. You can shoot an arrow through up to 5 rooms.\nIf your arrow hits the Wumpus, you win! If you enter the Wumpus's room,\nit eats you. If you shoot yourself, you die (embarrassing).\n\nYou can sense nearby hazards:\n- Wumpus nearby: 'I smell a Wumpus!'\n- Pit nearby: 'I feel a draft!'\n- Bats nearby: 'I hear bats!'\n\nGood luck, hunter!",
