## Setting Up Your First Adventure

Start small. A two-to-five room adventure you actually finish is more valuable than a sprawling hundred-room world left half complete.

### Minimum viable adventure

```json
{
  "id": "my_adventure",
  "title": "My First Adventure",
  "intro": "A short scene-setter sentence.",
  "start_room": 1,
  "rooms": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Starting Room",
      "description": "Brief, vivid description. One exit leads forward.",
      "exits": { "north": 2 },
      "items": [101]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Ending Room",
      "description": "The story concludes here.",
      "exits": { "south": 1 }
    }
  ],
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 101,
      "name": "Old Map",
      "description": "A tattered map with a red X marking the north cave.",
      "type": "readable",
      "weight": 0,
      "value": 0,
      "is_takeable": true,
      "location": 1
    }
  ],
  "monsters": [],
  "quests": []
}
```

Once this loads and plays correctly, expand by one room or one item at a time.

## Writing Effective Room Descriptions

The room description is the most important text in your adventure. Players will `look` repeatedly — make every word earn its place.

### The four-sentence structure

| Sentence | Job | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Immediate sensory impression | "Smoke hangs thick in the air." |
| 2 | What the player sees | "Overturned tables and scattered papers fill the tavern floor." |
| 3 | Detail or atmosphere | "A mournful tune plays from somewhere deeper in the building." |
| 4 | Optional hint | "A glint of metal catches your eye beneath the nearest table." |

### Do
- Use concrete nouns and active verbs: *"A torch gutters in the iron bracket"* not *"There is some light."*
- Imply exits through description: *"A heavy oak door stands to the north"* before the exits list.
- Hint at items without name-dropping them: *"Something shiny"*, not *"You see the Golden Key (takes 0 weight)"*.
- Vary sentence rhythm — mix short punchy sentences with longer atmospheric ones.

### Don't
- Repeat information the exits list already provides: "You can go north, south, or east" is redundant.
- Write walls of text. Three to six sentences is ideal.
- Use generic filler: *"a room"*, *"some stuff"*, *"things"*.
- Put gameplay instructions in descriptions: *"Pick up the key to proceed"* breaks immersion.

## Designing Your Map

A good map has shape and purpose. Plan it before writing descriptions.

### Map topologies

| Shape | Good for | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Linear** (A→B→C→D) | Tight narrative, tutorial | Boring if too long |
| **Hub and spoke** (central room, radiating paths) | Exploration, choice | Confusing without landmarks |
| **Loop** (paths that circle back) | Replayability, shortcuts | Disorienting if rooms look alike |
| **Layer cake** (surface → dungeon → deeper dungeon) | Epic scale | Backtracking frustration |

### Practical rules

1. **Every room needs a purpose.** If a room exists solely to exist, cut it or merge it.
2. **Use non-cardinal exits sparingly.** `palace`, `oracle`, `gates` are memorable but players must discover them in text.
3. **Provide safe anchors.** Give players a clearly-described home base to return to.
4. **Avoid dead ends except deliberately.** If a corridor leads nowhere, players assume a bug.
5. **Distance matters.** Don't put an essential healing item one room away from the final boss with no backtrack option.

### Connections table

Draw your map as a table before writing JSON:

```
Room  Name                North  South  East  West  Up  Down
1     Village Square      2      –      3     –     –   –
2     Kingsroad           4      1      5     –     –   –
3     Forest Entrance     –      –      –     1     –   –
…
```

Then translate each row into a room JSON object. This prevents broken exit references.

## Items: Utility vs Atmosphere

Items serve two purposes: mechanical utility (weapons, armor, consumables) and environmental storytelling (atmosphere items).

### Utility items

| Use | Fields to set |
|-----|---------------|
| Weapon | `is_weapon:true`, `weapon_type`, `weapon_dice`, `weapon_sides` |
| Armor | `is_armor:true`, `is_wearable:true`, `armor_value` |
| Healing consumable | `type:"edible"` or `"drinkable"`, `value` = HP healed |
| Readable (lore/clue) | `type:"readable"`, description = the full text the player reads |

### Atmosphere items

Atmosphere items (`type:"normal"`, `is_takeable:false`) exist to make rooms feel lived-in. A half-eaten loaf of bread, a cracked mirror, a child's lost shoe — these cost nothing and add everything.

Set `"is_takeable": false` to keep them in place.

### Economy guidelines

- **Default player gold:** 200. Items with `value > 200` will feel rare and rewarding.
- **Weapon balance:** For a fresh player with no weapon, challenge monsters to about hardiness 6–8. With a 1d6 weapon, a monster with hardiness 10 takes 2–5 hits.
- **Consumable healing:** Set `value` between 4 and 8 for standard potions. A `value:12` potion is a full heal for a default player — make it rare.
- **Weight:** Most items should weigh 1–5. A suit of plate armor at weight 15 forces real inventory decisions.

---

## Combat Balancing

The default player has **hardiness 12** (12 HP), no weapon equipped, and no armor.

### Damage math

**Unarmed player:** rolls 1 to 5 damage (based on default weapon_ability of 5).

**Example weapon progression:**

| Weapon | Dice | Average damage | Role |
|--------|------|---------------|------|
| Rusty Dagger | 1d4 | 2.5 | Starting weapon |
| Short Sword | 1d6 | 3.5 | Early dungeon |
| Longsword | 1d8 | 4.5 | Mid-game |
| Battleaxe | 1d10 | 5.5 | Late-game |
| Great Sword | 2d6 | 7.0 | Boss reward |

**Monster counter-attack:** formula is `1 to (agility÷3)+1`. With armor_value 0 on the player:

| Monster agility | Max hits per round | Attacks to kill default player (no armor) |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 6 | 3 | 4–12 |
| 9 | 4 | 3–12 |
| 12 | 5 | 3–12 |
| 18 | 7 | 2–12 |

### Tiering monsters

- **Trash mobs** (hardiness 4–6, agility 4–6): Killed in 1–2 hits; reward learning combat.
- **Standard enemies** (hardiness 8–12, agility 8–10): Require 2–4 hits; require equipped gear.
- **Mini-bosses** (hardiness 16–24, agility 10–14): Require a consumable or two.
- **Final boss** (hardiness 30+, agility 16+): Should reward all prior gear and consumable collection.

### Healing availability

Place one mid-tier consumable (value 4–6) per 3–4 combat rooms. Place a high-value consumable (value 10–12) before the final encounter. Never make the adventure unsolvable if the player played reasonably.

## Quest Design

### What makes a good quest

1. **Clear start:** The player knows WHAT they need to do.
2. **Observable progress:** Kill and collect quests track automatically; players see the counter.
3. **Meaningful reward:** Gold and XP should feel proportional to effort.
4. **Optional side objectives:** Mark optional objectives `"is_optional": true` for completionist players.

### Current objective types

| JSON `type` | Tracks when |
|-------------|-------------|
| `kill_monster` | You `attack` and kill a monster whose name contains `target_id` (as a string) |
| `collect_item` | You `take` an item whose name contains `target_id` (as a string) |
| `reach_room` | You enter a room with id matching `target_id` |
| `talk_to_npc` | You `say` to a non-hostile NPC matching `target_id` |

> **Tip:** `target_id` is an integer in JSON but is matched as a **partial string** against monster/item names. If your quest target is monster id `202` whose name is `"Goblin King"`, the system checks whether `"goblin king"` contains `"202"` — which it does not. Use the monster's id as a substring of its name for reliable matching:  
> Name: `"Goblin 202"` and `target_id: 202` — this works.  
> Better pattern: keep `target_id` as a meaningful number and name your monster something unique enough to match unambiguously.

### Quest chain design

- Use `prerequisites` to gate quest chains. Completing Quest 1 should unlock Quest 2.
- Do not create a quest that requires a monster to be killed that the player may not have triggered.
- Short chains (2–3 quests) work best in adventures under 20 rooms.

---

## NPC Design

In SagaCraft, NPCs are monsters with `friendliness: "friendly"` or `"neutral"`. They cannot be attacked if friendly.

### Friendly NPC tips

- Give them a high `hardiness` so they appear robust (not that they fight, but `status` won't show them as frail).
- Write their `description` assuming the player will `examine` them.
- Hook dialogue into quests: the `talk_to_npc` objective type triggers when the player `say`s near a matching NPC.

### Neutral NPC tips

- Use neutral for ambiguous characters: merchants, strangers, thieves-in-waiting.
- A neutral monster can BECOME plot-relevant when the player says the right thing (future event hook support).

---

## Pacing and Flow

### The rhythm of a good adventure

```
1. Establish the world (one to two safe rooms, no combat)
2. Introduce low-stakes challenge (easy enemy or light puzzle)
3. Reward exploration (hidden item, story revelation)
4. Escalate tension (stronger enemy, moral choice)
5. Climax (hardest fight or key decision)
6. Resolution (clear ending room, full quest reward)
```

### Gating progression

Use items as soft gates. A door that needs a key, a guard that needs a bribe, a mechanism that needs a component – these force exploration without hard-coding impossible routes.

Avoid hard gates in early rooms. Being stuck in room 2 with no forward progress is the fastest way to lose a player.

### Information density

Space out lore. One piece of world-building per three rooms is a comfortable pace. Clues to puzzles should appear one to two rooms before the puzzle, not right next to it.

## Playtesting Checklist

Before sharing your adventure, verify:

- [ ] `start_room` id exists in `rooms`
- [ ] Every room referenced in any `exits` value exists
- [ ] Every item id referenced in a room's `items` array exists in the top-level `items` array, OR the item has its `location` field set to that room's id
- [ ] Every monster's `room_id` corresponds to an existing room
- [ ] JSON is valid (use `python3 -m json.tool my_adventure.json` to check)
- [ ] The adventure is completable: trace the critical path from `start_room` to ending room
- [ ] Combat is fair: verify the player can survive with default stats on the critical path
- [ ] All quest `target_id` values match their monsters/items (test with `quests` and then kill/collect)
- [ ] Consumables exist to recover from the hardest fight
- [ ] All room descriptions are 3–6 sentences and reference their key items/exits

### Quick validation command

```bash
python3 -m json.tool my_adventure.json > /dev/null && echo "JSON valid" || echo "JSON error"
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### "My adventure just says Unknown command"

Players typed something you didn't expect. SagaCraft handles a fixed set of verbs — if you want custom interactions, use the quest `talk_to_npc` objective or implement a custom system in Rust.

### "Monsters are too hard / too easy"

Apply the tiering table above. A monster should be beatable with the gear available at the point in the adventure where it appears. If it's the first enemy, make it beatable unarmed.

### "Players can't pick up an item"

Verify `"is_takeable": true` (or omit the field — it defaults to `true`). Also verify the item's `location` matches the room where it should appear.

### "Quest progress never updates"

The `target_id` partial-string match must work. Trace through: if `target_id` is `202` and the monster is named `"Goblin Warrior"`, they will not match. Rename the monster to include `"202"` or change the naming convention.

### "Room exits look circular or players get lost"

Draw the map first. Every exit must make geographic sense. Use `look` output to give strong directional cues in descriptions (*"The road continues north"*, *"To the east a cave entrance yawns open"*).

### "The adventure crashes on load"

Run `python3 -m json.tool my_adventure.json` to find JSON syntax errors. Common causes: trailing commas, unclosed brackets, unescaped quotes in strings.
