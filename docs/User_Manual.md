## How to Play

SagaCraft is played entirely by typing commands and reading the responses. Everything happens at the keyboard.

When you start a new game you will see the title banner, optional introduction text, and then the first room description:

```
============================================================
              The Shattered Realms
============================================================

An ancient evil stirs beneath the kingdom…

Waking Village - The Morning After
-----------------------------------
You awaken in the smoldering ruins of what was once a peaceful
farming village…

Obvious exits: north, east, south
```

Type a command and press **Enter**. The engine responds, and you continue.

## Movement and Navigation

Each room description ends with a list of available exits:

```
Obvious exits: north, east, down
```

Type the direction (or its one-letter alias) to move. If a direction has no exit you will see:

```
You can't go that way.
```

Adventures can define exits with any name — you may encounter `gates`, `palace`, `oracle`, `secret`, `throne`, and similar in addition to cardinal directions. Always `look` after entering a new room to catch all available exits.

### Dark rooms

Some rooms are flagged `is_dark`. In a dark room you see:

```
It is pitch black. You can't see a thing.
```

You need a light-source item (defined in the adventure) to see in darkness.

---

## Reading a Room

The `look` command (or just `l`) prints the full room description at any time:

```
Throne Room
-----------
The throne room is a cavernous hall of marble and gold,
lit by massive crystal chandeliers that cast eerie shadows.

Obvious exits: south, secret

You see:
  - Dragon Crown
  - Forbidden Tome

Present:
  - Palace Guard (hostile)
  - Court Advisor
```

- **You see** — items in this room that can be examined or taken.
- **Present** — creatures. Their disposition is shown in parentheses:
  - `(hostile)` — will fight back when attacked
  - `(friendly)` — cannot be attacked
  - *(none)* — neutral

---

## Inventory Management

### Viewing your inventory

```
> inventory
Inventory (7/120 weight):
  - Rusty Sword [wielded]
  - Leather Armor [worn]
  - Ancient Key
  - Health Potion
```

`[wielded]` and `[worn]` mark actively equipped items.

### Carry weight limit

Your maximum carrying capacity is **hardiness × 10**. The default player has hardiness 12, giving a capacity of 120. Each item has a weight value. If picking something up exceeds the limit you will see:

```
Too heavy to carry! (115/120 weight used, Plate Mail weighs 15.)
```

Drop or use something first to free capacity.

### Taking and dropping

```
> take ancient key
Taken: Ancient Key.

> drop ancient key
Dropped: Ancient Key.
```

Items must be present in the current room to take. You must be holding an item to drop it.

### Examining items

```
> examine rusty sword
Rusty Sword
A worn blade with a chipped edge.
Damage: 1d8
Weight: 3  Value: 10 gold
```

`examine` works on things in your **inventory** and on things **in the room** — you do not need to pick something up to inspect it.

### Equipping and unequipping

```
> equip rusty sword
You wield the Rusty Sword.

> equip leather armor
You wear the Leather Armor.

> unequip weapon
Weapon unequipped.

> unequip armor
Armor removed.
```

Only weapons (`is_weapon: true`) and wearable armor (`is_wearable: true` or `is_armor: true`) can be equipped. Unequipping keeps the item in your inventory.

### Using items

| Item type | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Edible, Drinkable | Restores health equal to the item's **value**, clamped to [1, 20]. Health is capped at max hardiness. The item is consumed and removed. |
| Readable | Prints the item description. The item is kept. |
| Anything else | "You fiddle with it but nothing happens." |

```
> use health potion
You consume the Health Potion. Health: 12/12.
```

---

## Combat System

### Initiating combat

You start combat by attacking a monster explicitly:

```
> attack goblin
You attack the Goblin Warrior for 6 damage. It has 4 health remaining.
The Goblin Warrior strikes back for 2 damage. Your health: 10/12.
```

Attempting to attack a non-hostile creature is refused:

```
> attack merchant
You can't bring yourself to attack the friendly Merchant.
```

### How damage is calculated

**Your attack:**
- If you have a weapon equipped, the engine rolls that weapon's dice (e.g. `weapon_dice=1, weapon_sides=8` → 1–8 damage).
- If nothing is equipped, the engine uses your best weapon ability score (default 5) as the maximum of a random roll (1 to max).

**Monster counter-attack:**
- The monster rolls `1` to `(agility ÷ 3) + 1` damage (minimum 2).
- Your equipped armor's `armor_value` is subtracted from that, with a minimum of 1 damage.

**Example:** A monster with agility 9 deals up to `(9÷3)+1 = 4` raw damage per counter-attack. With Leather Armor (armor_value 2) you absorb 2 points, reducing the hit to at most 2. A monster with agility 3 would deal `(3÷3)+1 = 2` raw damage.

### Victory and death

- A monster that reaches 0 health is killed. You automatically collect any gold it carried.
- If your health reaches 0 the game ends immediately.

### After a fight

Use `status` to check your health. Heal with Edible or Drinkable items if available, then continue.

### Weapon type reference

| `weapon_type` value | Weapon category |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Axe |
| 2 | Bow |
| 3 | Club |
| 4 | Spear |
| 5 | Sword |

---

## Quests

### Listing quests

```
> quests
Active Quests:
- Slay the Goblin King: Defeat the leader of the warband
  Current Stage: Main Quest
    - Kill Goblin King (0/1)

Available Quests:
- Collect the Herb: Gather healing herbs from the forest
```

### Accepting a quest

```
> accept 3
Accepted quest: Collect the Herb
```

### Completing a quest

When all required objectives show `(1/1)` or greater, report completion:

```
> complete 3
Completed quest: 3 (+50 gold) (+100 XP)
```

Gold and XP are added to your totals immediately.

### How objectives track automatically

| Objective type | When it advances |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Kill | Every time you `attack` and kill a monster whose name matches the quest target |
| Collect | Every time you `take` an item whose name matches the quest target |
| Explore / Reach | Every time you enter the target room |
| Talk | When you `say` to a matching NPC |

Quest progress notifications appear automatically after the triggering action:

```
> attack goblin king
You defeat the Goblin King! (+25 gold)
Quest update:
[Slay the Goblin King] Kill Goblin King (1/1)
```

## Player Statistics

The `status` command shows your full character sheet:

```

Health: 10/12
Level: 1  XP: 0

| Level | 1 | Increases with XP; levels up at level×100 XP |

## Tips and Strategies

### Exploration
- `look` every time you enter a room — exits and items reset on each `look`.
- Exits can have non-standard names. Read room descriptions for door/portal/passage hints.
- Keep track of visited rooms manually or with notes — there is no built-in map.

### Combat
- Check `status` before a fight. Heal first if your health is under half.
- `examine` a monster's weapon (visible in the room) before attacking heavily armed foes.
- Equip your best weapon and appropriate armor before engaging.
- If a fight is going badly, there is no automatic retreat — plan carefully.

### Inventory
- Consumables with higher `value` heal more HP. Prioritise high-value potions/food.
- Treasure items are mostly dead weight mid-adventure; drop them if encumbered.
- Use `examine` on room items before taking them — some carry crucial story clues in their description.

### Quests
- Accept quests the moment they appear; kill and collect objectives track automatically as you play.
- Complete finished quests promptly to bank rewards before dying.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `Unknown command: …` | Check spelling; type `help` for valid commands |
| `You can't take that.` | Item is not in the current room, or is flagged non-takeable |
| `Too heavy to carry!` | Drop or consume items to free carry weight |
| `You can't bring yourself to attack…` | Target is not hostile; only attack hostile creatures |
| `There's no X here to attack.` | Name didn't match; try a short partial name |
| Adventure won't load | Verify the path is correct and the JSON is valid |
| Dark room with no light | Look for a torch or lantern item in earlier rooms |
