# Example Mods

These sample mods demonstrate how to extend the Colossal StoryWorks engine with the modding API.

- `warm_welcome.py` – Adds a celebratory greeting in the starting room and introduces a `wave` command.
- `treasure_cache.py` – Spawns a bonus treasure chest whenever a hostile monster is defeated.

Copy any of these files into your own mod folder or use them as templates for new creations.
